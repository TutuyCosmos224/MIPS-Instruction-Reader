# MIPS-Instruction-Reader
This code is to simulate how a computer works when processing MIPS instructions using C++. My code was able to process lines of MIPS instructions and translate them into a 32-bit machine code, and to simulate the process of storing it into the proper memory address. The MIPS instructions are inputted using an IN file format, while the code will then export the corresponding 32-bit machine code into an OUT file format. I will also include an example for the input and output files of the MIPS program in the assembler-sample folder.
